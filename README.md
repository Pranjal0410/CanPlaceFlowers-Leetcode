Can Place Flowers
Description
This project provides a solution to the "Can Place Flowers" problem. The problem statement is as follows:

Given a flowerbed in the form of an array with 0 and 1, where 0 represents empty spots and 1 represents planted flowers, you need to determine if it's possible to place new flowers in the empty spots without violating the following rules:

No two adjacent flowerbeds have flowers.
You cannot place flowers in adjacent spots.
The project offers a Python implementation to solve this problem efficiently.

Usage
You can use the can_place_flowers function to determine if you can place flowers in the given flowerbed. Here's how to use it:

python
Copy code
from can_place_flowers import can_place_flowers

flowerbed = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
n = 1

result = can_place_flowers(flowerbed, n)
print(result)
flowerbed should be a list representing the flowerbed with 0s and 1s.
n is the number of new flowers you want to place.
Algorithm
The algorithm used in this project iterates through the flowerbed array, checking each position to see if it can accommodate a new flower without violating the rules. The main idea is to check each spot and its adjacent spots to determine if it's possible to plant a flower.

The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the flowerbed.
